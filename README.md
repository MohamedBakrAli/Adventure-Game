# Python Adventure Game

This is a part of my Udacity course under Python Programming. This is a simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. 

## What does this do?

This project is a very short and simple text-based game with a couple of choices available to the player. There are a few key things that needs to be met in order to make a working game:

* The game gives players a description of waht's happneing, and then asks them to make a choice.
* Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
* The game also includes some random factors.
* The game has conditions for winning and losing.
* When the game is over, it asks the player if he/she wants to play again.

## What technologies did you use in making this game?

I have used Python in making this text-based game. An understanding of functional programming was also helpful when I made this game.

## Installation

In order to play the game, clone the repository to your computer:

```
git clone https://github.com/MohamedBakrAli/Adventure-Game

```

Open up a new terminal window and run the command:
